title: Upper Triangular Matrix
---

# Upper triangular matrix

- It is a square matrix
- It is denoted by $U$
- All the entries _below_ the main diagonal are zero.


$$
U(i,j)=0, \forall i>j
$$

## Backward substitution

A system 

$$
Ux=y
$$

Is solved by backward substitution.

## Upper unitriangular matrix

If the entries on the main diagonal of a upper or lower triangular matrix are all 1, the matrix is called upper or lower **unitriangular**.

> Strictly triangular matrix: If all of the entries on the main diagonal of a (upper or lower) triangular matrix are also 0, the matrix is called **strictly** (upper or lower) **triangular**.

## Properties

Upper triangularity is preserved by many operations:

- The sum of two upper triangular matrices is upper triangular.
- The product of two upper triangular matrices is upper triangular.
- The inverse of an upper triangular matrix, if it exists, is upper triangular.
- The product of an upper triangular matrix and a scalar is upper triangular.
